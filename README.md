# YT-UI-Hider

Hides the Youtube player UI on the press of a key (H by default) even when paused.

This is an adapted version of stefnotch's script at https://gist.github.com/stefnotch/4824a9621e4dfa0e0a4a34043cdb544a which in turn is an adapted version of jscher2000's script https://support.mozilla.org/en-US/questions/1149257 .

### Install

1. Make sure you have Greasemonkey (or compatible) installed.
2. Go to https://github.com/Sylirana/YT-UI-Hider/raw/master/yt-ui-hider.user.js and install the script.
3. (Optional) If you would like to change the key used to hide the UI, replace the `h` on line 18 with another character. Keep in mind that some keys are already used by Youtube by default ( https://support.google.com/youtube/answer/7631406 ).
4. Watch a video on Youtube and press `h` or your custom key to hide and show the UI.
